# Unlocking Insights in Vehicle Alert Generation: Patterns, Correlations, and Locations

 Ensuring road safety is incredibly
important, in today's world with the increasing
number of vehicles on the roads. This study delves
into an analysis of how vehicle alert generation
patterns impact road safety. By examining outliers
correlations between vehicle Speed and alerts
variations in generation over time and spatial
insights we aim to provide insights on how to
enhance road safety. Our findings highlight the
significance of identifying outliers when it comes
to understand and addressing risks in the
road. 

We also show that there isn't always a
correlation between vehicle speed and the
frequency of generated alerts. This emphasizes the
need for a nuanced approach to monitoring road
safety. Additionally our analysis reveals peak alert
hours throughout the day which can guide the
implementation of safety measures during times.
Furthermore, we investigate how daytime alert
generation relates to road safety and shed light on
the challenges faced during times of the day.

Moreover, by examining alerts, we uncover factors
to consider for effective alert management and
system optimization.
Lastly, our examination of locations provides
insights, into high-risk areas. This knowledge
allows for the implementation of safety measures and
targeted interventions.
